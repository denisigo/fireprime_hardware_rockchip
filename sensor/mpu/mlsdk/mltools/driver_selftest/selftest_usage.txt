Usage information for the mlsl driver self-test
-----------------------------------------------

The driver self-test is intended to help check the correctness
of mlsl on new platforms.  It performs a variety of tests in
an attempt to test the interface between the host processor
and the MPU.

1. Building the self-test application:

The driver self-test code should be compiled into an executable
with the included Makefile.
The resulting executable should be deployed to the target device.

2. Using the self-test application

The self-test application takes several command line arguments.

2.1 Required arguments:

2.2 Optional arguments

  -a 0xXX : where XX is the address of the accelerometer
  -d 0xXX : where XX is the first register on the accelerometer 
			that contains sensor data
  -l 0xXX : where XX is the number of sensor data registers
  -w 0xXX : where XX is the expected value of the whoami register on the MPU
             the default is 0x68

2.3 Helper & Flags

  -h : print help summary
  -v : verbose mode, lots of output from the tests
  -f : abort after the first failed test. 
 	   By default it will continue until the end and exit.

2.3 Example usage

   ./driver_self_test -a 0x18 -d 0x02 -l 0x06

2.4 Test output

   The self-test application outputs its results to both the console and a 
   test report file.  The output file is called test_report.txt.  For each test,
   the output contains a short description of the test and an indication as
   to whether the test passed or failed.  Not all tests may be implemented for
   all platforms.  The self-test application will indicate which tests are 
   unimplemented; these tests will be marked as failed.

   When all implemented tests pass, the mlsl should be considered ready for use
   with the mpl.
